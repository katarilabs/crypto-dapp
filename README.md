# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## 1. Create a `.env` file in the root, please use the `.env.example` file like a base template

## 2. Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
